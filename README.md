# Applied-Financial-Statement-Analysis
The financial analysis of Godrej Consumer Products from 2019 to 2023 reflects consistent growth in assets and equity, highlighting long-term financial strength. However, key profitability ratios like ROCE and ROE have declined, indicating reduced efficiency in capital utilization. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted operations in 2021, leading to fluctuations in sales and profits. Despite this, the company maintained positive cash flows from operations, showing strong core business performance. Liquidity improved, as seen in rising current and quick ratios, though cash reserves fell due to continued investment and financing outflows. Working capital has strengthened over time, while non-cash working capital remained inconsistent. Operational efficiency improved in 2023, with better inventory and receivable turnover. However, declining net profit margins and return ratios reflect growing financial pressure. The DuPont analysis confirmed a drop in shareholder returns, pointing to weakened profitability. To ensure sustainable growth, the company must focus on cost management, improving margins, and optimizing capital allocation.
