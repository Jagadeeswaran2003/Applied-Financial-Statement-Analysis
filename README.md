The analysis of Godrej Consumer Products from 2019 to 2023 reveals steady asset and equity growth but declining profitability ratios, such as ROCE and ROE. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted performance in 2021, causing fluctuations in sales and profits. Liquidity improved, though cash reserves declined due to high investment and financing outflows. Working capital strengthened, but debtor control needs improvement. Overall, the company remains financially sound, and focusing on cost control, capital optimization, and operational efficiency can drive future profitability and stability.
